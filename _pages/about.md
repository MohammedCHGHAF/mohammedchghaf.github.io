I am a Localization & HD Mapping Engineer specializing in Automated Driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (AD/ADAS) at [AMPERE](https://www.ampere.cars/). 

I completed my PhD in 2023 from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), where I worked at [SATIE Laboratory](https://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr) under the supervision of [Sergio Rodríguez Flórez](https://hebergement.universite-paris-saclay.fr/sergio.rodriguez/) and [Abdelhafid El Ouardi](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=XeCMgjwAAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral thesis investigated data fusion techniques for multimodal SLAM on embedded systems, enabling efficient real-time localization and mapping for automated driving.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated from [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) ([M2 Embedded Systems & Data Fusion](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/electronique-energie-electrique-automatique/m2-systemes-embarques-et-traitement-de-linformation)) and [Mohammadia School of Engineers](https://www.emi.ac.ma/emi/) (Automation & Control Engineering).
